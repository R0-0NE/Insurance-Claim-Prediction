# Insurance-Claim-Prediction

This project aims to predict whether an individual will file an insurance claim based on various features such as demographic and health-related information. The dataset used contains the following features:

### Dataset Overview:

age: Age of the individual.
sex: Gender of the individual.
bmi: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
steps: Number of steps taken by the individual.
children: Number of children covered by health insurance.
smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker (1 for smoker, 0 for non-smoker).
charges: The medical charges billed to the individual.
insuranceclaim: Whether an insurance claim was made (1 for claim, 0 for no claim).

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict whether an individual will file an insurance claim based on the provided features.

### Steps Involved:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifying trends, correlations, and patterns within the data to inform model selection.
3. Model Building: Implementing and evaluating multiple machine learning models to determine the best fit for the prediction task.
4. Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
